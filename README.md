# CF RunLoop  VS  GCD

## Access the Main Thread like a Boss! :sunglasses:

The demo app you can play with and see the difference between using GCD dispatch_async approach versus CF RunLoop block execution on the Main Thread.

Two very different APIs, but the trick is that the Core Foundation approach with CFRunLoopPerformBlock allows us to choose a specific RunLoop Mode we want to use for our block. Especially in the case of scrolling TableView, it makes a big difference since all scrolling happens with UITrackingRunLoopMode.


```swift

            switch self.cellImageAssignMode {
                
            case .GCD:
                DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: { () -> Void in
                    
                    let image = UIImage(data: data!)
                    cell.thumbnailImage.image = image
                })
                
            case .RunLoop:
                CFRunLoopPerformBlock(CFRunLoopGetMain(), RunLoop.Mode.tracking as CFTypeRef) {
                    
                    let image = UIImage(data: data!)
                    cell.thumbnailImage.image = image
                }
            }
```


Using a fast scroll down to 2-4XXX cells, stop the scroll and see how "GCD" tab cells are assigned with colored images blinking versus "RunLoop" tab cells are assigned with minimal visible UI lags.

TableViews loading data from a network are identical on both sides of the screen. However, the left one uses UITrackingRunLoopMode to update image data with Core Foundation CFRunLoopPerformBlock manually. GCD API accesses the Main Thread, essentially delegating RunLoop mode selection to Grand Central Dispatch.
