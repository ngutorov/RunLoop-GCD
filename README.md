# CF RunLoop  VS  GCD

## Access the Main Thread like a Boss! :sunglasses:

The demo app you can play with and see the difference between using GCD `dispatch_async` approach versus CF RunLoop block execution on the Main Thread.

Two very different APIs, but the trick is that the Core Foundation approach with `CFRunLoopPerformBlock` allows us to choose a specific `RunLoop mode` we want to use for our block. Especially in the case of scrolling TableView, it makes a big difference since all scrolling happens with UITrackingRunLoopMode.


```swift

            switch self.cellImageAssignMode {
                
            case .GCD:
                DispatchQueue.main.async(execute: { () -> Void in
                    
                    let image = UIImage(data: data!)
                    cell.thumbnailImage.image = image
                })
                
            case .RunLoop:
                CFRunLoopPerformBlock(CFRunLoopGetMain(), RunLoop.Mode.tracking as CFTypeRef) {
                    
                    let image = UIImage(data: data!)
                    cell.thumbnailImage.image = image
                }
            }
```


Using a fast scroll down to 2-4XXX cells, stop the scroll and see how `"GCD" tab` cells are assigned with colored images blinking versus `"RunLoop" tab` cells are assigned with minimal visible UI lags.

TableViews loading data from a network are identical in both cases. However, the left tab uses `UITrackingRunLoopMode` to update image data with `Core Foundation CFRunLoopPerformBlock` manually. 

The right tab uses GCD API to accesses the Main Thread, essentially delegating `RunLoop mode` selection to `Grand Central Dispatch`.
